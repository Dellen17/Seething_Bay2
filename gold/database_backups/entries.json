Emotional health can be improved by taking care of the physical health, when you eat good, sleep well, excercise etc. you naturally feel good. But other methods involve being productive, spending time with loved ones and so on.

Thankfully for me, it was the subject I loved the most out of all subjects I did. I loved it because I understood it. In elementary I would usually get awards in Numeracy, everyone knew that was MY award. When they would announce the winners of each award, 'Gabriel Katara' was a name that would be called for Numeracy, no one touched that award more than me in my classes back then. My love for Math fell in grade 9 where I completely lost interest in school, due to poor teaching by the teacher, but it was re-ignited when we got a new teacher who was very good at teaching. He knew I was smart in Math, so unsurprisingly, I was one of his favorite students. I still love Math now, years after graduating.
